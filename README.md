## Polyphonic Synthesizer
Description of functionality, how to use it, and any supporting equipment required

The polyphonic synthesizer will take up to 12 button inputs that each represent one of the notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, and B. The device will allow for both individual and groups of notes to be played. Since a PWM signal will be produced as the output, a speaker with a low-pass filter will be required to make a DAC and produce sounds that can be heard. 

## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and labels

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams

## Some Legal Statement
From Purdue that I haven't figured out yet, maybe some stuff about Dr. J, the program, and other instructors
